### Create Performance Task - Work Day 1

**AIMS:** 
* What specific steps can I take to use today's class time productively to begin working on my Create Performance Task?
* In what ways can my debugging buddies help me in using today's class time productively to begin working on my Create Performance Task?
* In what ways can I help my debugging buddies  in using today's class time productively to begin working on their create performance tasks?

**OUTCOME ALIGNMENT:**

<ins>IEC.TYS61XT.6</ins>: Engage in the design thinking process to iteratively develop your work.
<br><ins>IEC.TYS61XT.8</ins> Model employability skills such as personal mindset, planning for success, and collaboration.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**

- [ ] I have clearly and concisely described at least two different ideas for my Create PT with my debugging buddies.
	- [ ] I have clearly and concisely describe the purpose of each of my Create PT program ideas (e.g. who it helps, what problem it solves, why it is important, etc.)
	- [ ] I have clearly and concisely describe how each of my Create PT program ideas will run (e.g. "First..., Next..., Next..., Finally...") 
	- [ ] I have named at least one example of input (e.g. 'The user will click...') and at least one example of output (e.g., 'My program will display')
- [ ] I have provided each of my debugging buddies with clear, concise, and actionable feedback for each of their Create PT ideas.
- [ ] I can describe the feedback each of my debugging buddies has provided for each of my Create PT program ideas.

**DO NOW:** 

1. With your debugging buddies, gather at a location in the room away from other groups.
2. Select a a facilitator.  The role of the facilitator will be to lead and serve as a timekeeper for the protocol below.
3. Select a presentation order. (Who will present first?, second?, etc.)

**AGENDA:**

1. Feedback Protocol
2. Create PT Reminders

**FEEDBACK PROTOCOL:**

**Round 1:**
1. First presenter shares first idea. (3 minutes)
2. Each debugging buddy provides feedback (***Hint:** Refer to Success Criteria.*) (1 minute each)
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all other presenters.

**Round 2:**
1. First presenter shares second idea. (3 minutes)
2. Each debugging buddy provides feedback (***Hint:** Refer to Success Criteria.*) (1 minute each)
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all other presenters.

**Individual Think / Revise Time:** Select one of your Create PT ideas, write it down, and describe a couple of ways in which you might revise what you originally presented based on the feedback you received from peers.

**Round 3:**
1. First presenter quickly shares their initial idea and one way in which they might revise it. (1 minute each)
2. Repeat step 1 for all other presenters.

**HOMEWORK:** 

1. In your GitHub portfolio, create a new folder titled, `Create PT`.
2. In your virtual environment, create a file titled, `LastNameFirstInitial_CreatePT.py`
3. In your `LastNameFirstInitial_CreatePT.py` file, use code comments to describe your initial plan for the Create PT.  Remember to...
   * Incorporate the feedback you received from your debugging buddies during today's activity.
   * Describe the purpose of your propgram (e.g. who will it help?, what problem will it solve?, why it is important?, etc.)
   * Describe how your program will run (e.g. "First..., Next..., Next..., Finally...")
   * Describe at least one example of input (e.g. 'The user will click...') and at least one example of output (e.g., 'My program will display')
4. Upload your `LastNameFirstInitial_CreatePT.py` file to your `Create PT` folder in your GitHub portfolio.
