### Create Performance Task - Work Day 2

**AIMS:** 
* What specific steps can I take to use today's class time productively to continue working on my Create Performance Task?
* In what ways can my debugging buddies help me in using today's class time productively to continue working on my Create Performance Task?
* In what ways can I help my debugging buddies in using today's class time productively to continue working on their create performance tasks?

**OUTCOME ALIGNMENT:**

<ins>IEC.TYS61XT.2</ins>: Apply computational thinking skills to a variety of tasks.
<br><ins>IEC.TYS61XT.6</ins>: Engage in the design thinking process to iteratively develop your work.
<br><ins>IEC.TYS61XT.8</ins>: Model employability skills such as personal mindset, planning for success, and collaboration.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**

- [ ] I have used code comments to describe an algorithm for my Create PT task from beginning to end.
- [ ] I am making **progress** toward ensuring that I have met all program requirements.
	- [ ] My algorithm has sequencing. (an algorithm)
  - [ ] My algorithm has selection. (conditionals)
  - [ ] My algorithm has iteration. (loops)
  - [ ] My algorithm has a list.
  - [ ] My algorithm has a student-defined function. 
- [ ] My algorithm is not overly complicated. 	
- [ ] I have clearly and concisely presented my algorithm to my debugging buddies.
- [ ] I have provided each of my debugging buddies with clear, concise, and actionable feedback for each of their Create PT ideas.
- [ ] I can describe the feedback each of my debugging buddies has given me.
- [ ] I have updated my Create PT file in my Create PT folder on GitHub to reflect capture the work I completed today.

**DO NOW:** 

1. With your debugging buddies, gather at a location in the room away from other groups.
2. Select a a facilitator.  The role of the facilitator will be to lead and serve as a timekeeper for the protocol below.
3. Select a presentation order. (Who will present first?, second?, etc.)

**AGENDA:**

1. Independent Work Time Round 1
2. Feedback Protocol Round 1
3. Independent Work Time Round 2
4. Feedback Protocol Round 2
5. Create PT Reminders

**FEEDBACK PROTOCOL:**

1. First presenter shares algorithm. (3 minutes)
2. Each debugging buddy provides feedback (***Hint:** Refer to Success Criteria.*) (1 to 2 minutes each)
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all other presenters.

**HOMEWORK:** 

1. Based on the feedback you received from your debugging buddies, modify your algorithm.
2. Using the comments you wrote (and revised) today as subgoal labels, begin writing some code for your Create PT.
3. Update your Create PT file in your Create PT folder on GitHub.
